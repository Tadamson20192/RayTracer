This program implements a ray tracer which shoots a ray from the users view to a pixel in the image. If this ray intersects with one or more objects it determines which one it intersects first and fills the pixel accordingly. This program also attempts to inplement shading by casting a ray from the intersect point to a light source. However there were issues with this where it would overwrite the top image.
